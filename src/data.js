Before that I built TiroMoMangaung, a job board for my area, and along the way a fully tested payroll system, a desktop remote for an Arduino and a salon booking app. Most recently I have been building native iOS apps in Swift: Zaka, an offline-first expense tracker, and Yetsa, a planner that budgets the free windows in a day.',
